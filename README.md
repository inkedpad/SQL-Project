  - `Calls`
  - `Reasons`
  - `Customers`

   - Ensure that the required tables (`Calls`, `Reasons`, `Customers`, `sentiment_statistics`) exist in your SQL database.

2. **Run the Scripts:**
   - Execute the SQL scripts in the order provided in the code files. 
   - Use a SQL client or command line to run each script.

3. **Review the Output:**
   - After executing each script, check the newly created tables to ensure that data has been populated correctly.
   - Verify that all tables required for your analysis are present and contain the expected data.

4. **Analyze the Results:**
   - Use the generated tables to perform further analysis as needed for your project.

## Additional Notes
